# The "Ukraine" theme for IntelliJ Idea

The "Ukraine" theme for this IDE boasts a sophisticated and dark aesthetic, creating a visually immersive coding environment.

- The predominant dark background not only reduces eye strain during long coding sessions but also enhances focus on code elements.
- The choice of a vibrant yellow font color adds a touch of warmth and contrast, making code snippets and syntax elements easily distinguishable.
- This color combination not only reflects the sleekness of modern design but also pays homage to Ukraine's national colors, creating a visually appealing and functional coding experience.
